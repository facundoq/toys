# toys

Small programming projects

* actions-view: Typescript app to visualize Kinect-like gesture/action databases, using d3 for plotting, jquery ui for layout, and jade for templating. [Demo](http://facundoq.github.io/action-view/)
* cic-fly: A small python app to analyze fruit fly heartbeats through fluorescence images. Using PIL, numpy, scipy, tkinker. 
* crappy-dbms:   A toy relational dbms with pessimistic concurrency control, in Java 
* dft: various toy dft implementations in matlab with slides
* distopia: old, unfinished, Java/swing/Graphics2D top-down 2D rpg game.
* gest: Gesture Recognition w/ Kinect 1 (c#, various algorithms)
* julia-rotate: basic image rotation algorithms in Julia
* hog: pure Python/Numpy visualization of [Histogram of Oriented Gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients) [paper](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf)
* pedestrian_detection: added pedestrian detection sample pipeline with python/numpy/skimage/hogs/svm/sklearn for dataset Daimler Mono.
* mazes: various maze generation algorithms in Scala/ScalaJS. [Demo](http://facundoq.github.io/mazes/)
* pca: example on how to use pca to reconstruct missing data (w/ 3D synthetic generated data). Also comparison with linear regression. Using python, numpy and sklearn.
* random_image: testing simple image generation schemes
* rsa: toy rsa implementation in Haskell.
* speech_synthesis:  A toylike diphone-based concatenative tts for the grammar (CV)+, where C={'m','l','p','k','s'} and V={'a','A'}. Using python and numpy.
